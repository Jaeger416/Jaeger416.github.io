Hello and welcome! I am a Researcher at [CPII](https://cpii.hk/) of [CUHK InnoHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/research/innohk-centres/perceptual-and-interactive-intelligence.html) working with [Prof.Hongsheng Li](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/). I'm interested in generative models, 3D vision and perception models in autonomous driving system. In particular, I'm motivated by enabling AI to understand environment and human behaviour efficiently.

Before that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Automotive Engineering from Tongji University, Shanghai. During my undergraduate period, I worked in
[TJU Racing Team](http://www.tjuracing.com/) under [Prof.Liguang Li](https://autoen.tongji.edu.cn/info/1098/1060.htm)'s guidance for 3 years mainly focusing on powertrain and aerodynamic design and simulation. Together with all other teammates we won the champion of [Formula SAE China](http://www.formulastudent.com.cn/) and third place and Best Aerodynamics Award of [Formula SAE Japan](https://www.jsae.or.jp/formula/en/) in 2019, third place of of [Formula SAE China](http://www.formulastudent.com.cn/) in 2020
